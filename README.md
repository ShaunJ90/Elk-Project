![ELK Network](ELK%20Network.png)

This network allows me to access my jump box from my public IP address specified in the network rules. Port 22 is allowed from my public IP specifically so that I can SSH into my jump box. The jump box is used as an administration point so that I can access both of my web servers in addition to my ELK server.
